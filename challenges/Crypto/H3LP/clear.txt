Woody, I stole Andy's old cellphone to warn you : I feel like Bo-Peep was kidnapped.. My investigations are leading me to the infamous Zurg. Mr Potato and Rex are helping me on this. Meet me tonight, 7p.m, at PizzaPlanet. I heard that one of the Little Green Men might have seen something.
Don't worry cow-boy : we have a friend in need, and we will not rest until he's safe in andy's room.
Take care.
